|Use of version control tools|-score- | 
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|-score- | 
|Use of code formatters. |-score- | config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|

|Other automated analysis tools|-score- | config files in GH|
|Test cases exist|-score- | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|-score- | E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|-score- | 
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|-score- | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|-score- | Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|-score- | If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | all files appear to be accessible |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 2 | There are no requirements so not a lot required to be the same. Python version not specifically specified. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 0 | n/a for hw5 | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 | contributors are working in different places within the code folder |
|Short release cycles | 3 |  (hard to see in short projects) frequent commits throughout duration of project |
