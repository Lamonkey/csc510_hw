|Video1| -score- | For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of old functionality| 
|Video2|-score- | For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. For everyone else, 2min video of all functionality.| 
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|-score- | evidence in GH|
|Number of commits|-score- | in GH|
|Number of commits: by different people|-score- | in GH|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|-score- | 
|Issues are being closed|-score- | evidence in GH|
|DOI badge: exists|-score- | in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |-score- | in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |-score- | 
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|-score- | doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|-score- | 
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|-score- | 
|Use of version control tools|-score- | 
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|-score- | 
|Use of code formatters. |-score- | config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
|Use of syntax checkers. |-score- | config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
|Use of code coverage |-score- | config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools|-score- | config files in GH|
|Test cases exist|-score- | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|-score- | E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|-score- | 
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|-score- | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|-score- | Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|-score- | If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|-score- | 
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|-score- | 
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|-score- | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|-score- | 
|Short release cycles |-score- |  (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
