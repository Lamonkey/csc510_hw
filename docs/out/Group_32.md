|Use of version control tools|-score- | 
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|-score- | 
|Use of code formatters. |-score- | config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
|Use of syntax checkers. |-score- | config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
|Use of code coverage |-score- | config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools|-score- | config files in GH|
|Test cases exist|-score- | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|-score- | E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|-score- | 
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|-score- | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|-score- | Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|-score- | If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | all tools and files accessible |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | requirements and config files are in repo. not many tools to specify |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 0 | n/a for hw5|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | people are contributing in different places but seems slightly [imbalanced](https://github.com/sohambapat/SWE-Group-32-Assignments/graphs/contributors)|
|Short release cycles | 3 |  (hard to see in short projects) consistent and frequent [commits](https://github.com/sohambapat/SWE-Group-32-Assignments/graphs/contributors)|
