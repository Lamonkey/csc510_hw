|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | all tools and files accessible |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | requirements and config files are in repo. not many tools to specify |
